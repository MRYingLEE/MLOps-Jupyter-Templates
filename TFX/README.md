# TensorFlow Extended (TFX) is an end-to-end platform for deploying production ML pipelines

![The architecture of TFX](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/images/libraries_components.png "The architecture of TFX")
 

# TFX is tightly bundled with Tensorflow, but data validation, preprocessing and transform functions can be used beyond Tensorflow.

You may use TFX to prepare your dataset and use other frameworks, such as PyTorch or Kubeflow, to train and serve.


# TFX can run in any Jupyter Notebook, such as Colab

Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free Jupyter Notebook service. So it is convenient to use TFX in Colab.
